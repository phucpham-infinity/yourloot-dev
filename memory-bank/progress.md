# Progress

## Completed Work

### Component Extraction

- ✅ Created `CustomSelect` component in `src/components/common/custom-select/index.tsx`
- ✅ Extracted all styling and functionality from the inline Select in `select-field.tsx`
- ✅ Updated `select-field.tsx` to use the new `CustomSelect` component
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript type issues with string/number value handling
- ✅ Maintained all original functionality and styling

## What Works

- The new `CustomSelect` component is fully functional and reusable
- All original styling (gradient backgrounds, hover effects, etc.) is preserved
- Form field integration works correctly with validation
- Custom option rendering is supported
- TypeScript types are properly handled

## Current Status

- Component extraction is complete
- The `CustomSelect` component can now be used independently throughout the application
- The `SelectField` component is cleaner and more maintainable

## Known Issues

- None identified

## Next Steps

- The `CustomSelect` component is ready for use in other parts of the application
- Consider creating additional variants if needed (e.g., searchable version)
- May want to add more customization options in the future
